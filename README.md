# angular-elements-talk

This is the code from my talk.

* elements-lite - the lite version of `@angular/elements` that I did.
* github-app - simple application with `angular/elements`.
* html5-github-app - angular in html5 example.
* react-github-app - angular in react example.

## Meetup

I was talking in depth about how to use `angular/elements` everywhere like in `html5` and `react`, then I explain how angular elements build using the lite version I built. and how to use elements in the production.

## The talk - Build with Angular, use everywhere - Angular Elements


### [Slides here](https://www.slideshare.net/ShlomiLevi/build-with-angular-use-everywhere-angular-elements)
You just built an awesome component for your team or one of your projects. But you've heard that another team needs to build the same component which you just built. The problem is that they use React and you did it in Angular! This is sounds familiar right? This talk is a deep dive into the new v6 feature that let us reuse Angular components in others frameworks. Weâ€™ll dig into whatâ€™s available, provide insights into how they were built, and provide a tour of how to use them.
